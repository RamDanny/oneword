Bytesized Password Manager

Welcome to Oneword!

* This is a small project made to easily store and retrieve passwords locally

* The source code is written entirely in Python

* In addition to inbuilt Python libraries, the libraries used by the Python scripts are:
  1. Pycryptodomex -- For cryptography (https://www.pycryptodome.org/src/introduction)
  2. TinyDB -- For storage (https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  3. All-escapes -- For representing binary esscapes in text (https://pypi.org/project/all-escapes/)

* The only thing to remember is to keep noting down the passphrase generated for every session. This is done for security reasons
